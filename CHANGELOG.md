# Changelog

Each version here becomes a release on GitHub. The notes under a version are
what admins see in Settings → Software Updates before they click Update Now,
so write them for the people using the app.

## 5.1.0

The first numbered release. From now on, updates can be installed from Settings.

**New**
- Settings → Software Updates shows the installed version and any newer
  release with its notes. Click Update Now to install it. The app makes a
  recovery backup first, pauses saving for a few minutes while it restarts, and
  puts the previous version and your data back by itself if the new version
  doesn't work. Every attempt is listed in the update history.
- Admins see a notice at the top of the page when a new version is available.
- Encrypted cloud backups to your own Backblaze B2 bucket, every 30 minutes,
  with Test Restore, Download and Restore buttons.
- Admin switches to turn the AI receipt reading features on and off.
- Settings → Login Screen: change the company name, welcome line and logo
  shown on the sign-in page.

**Fixed**
- Buttons that were broken or hard to reach on phones.
- Backups could catch a receipt halfway through being saved or deleted.
